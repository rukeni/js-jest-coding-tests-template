# js-tdd-coding-tests-template

Hi ðŸ‘‹ Are you going to use jest while solving coding test questions?

I prepared a very simple jest template.

If you use TDD to solve the problem, it would be a very easy choice.

Simply press the "Use this template" button to use it.

If there is any problem, please let me know through Issue.

Thank you.
